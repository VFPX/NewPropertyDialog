<br>The replacement for the Edit Property/Method dialog has the following features:<p><img src="images\figure3.gif"><p><ul><li>It automatically selects the chosen member when you right-click a member in the Properties window and choose Edit Property/Method from the shortcut menu.<p><li>While it's easy to add a member to the Favorites tab of the Properties window (right-click and choose Add to Favorites), there isn't an easy way to remove it from Favorites. The replacement dialog has a Favorites button, making it easy to add or remove a member from Favorites.<p><li>If you delete a member that has associated member data, the member data is automatically removed for that member.<p><li>It automatically updates the member data when you rename a member so it respects the case of the member's name.<p><li>It's non-modal. That means you can keep it open, edit some properties or methods, switch to other things, come back, and edit some more members.<p><li>How many times have you accidentally selected the wrong dialog when you created a new member, resulting in a property when you meant to create a method? With the replacement dialog, you can change a property to a method and vice versa.<p><li>Selecting the description of a member and pressing Ctrl+C to copy it causes the Apply button to become enabled in the native dialog, requiring you to either choose Apply or Cancel to close the dialog (pressing Esc brings up a "save changes" dialog). The replacement dialog does not have this behavior.<p><li>The New button launches the <a href="_2630mv15i.htm" >replacement New Property/Method dialog</a>.<p><li>It's dockable: try tab-docking it with Properties window.<p><li>It's resizable and persists its size and position to your resource (FOXUSER) file.<p><li>The Zoom window (right-click on the Properties window for a property and choose Zoom) is resizable.<br></ul><br>
