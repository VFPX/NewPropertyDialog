<br>Like the New Property/Method dialog, the Edit Property/Method dialog leaves a few things to be desired. For example, when you right-click a member in the Properties window and choose Edit Property/Method from the shortcut menu, the chosen member isn't automatically selected in the dialog: there's a dashed line around it, but it isn't selected in the list. You have to specifically click the member in the list to select it. Fortunately, like the New Property/Method dialog, this dialog can be replaced.<p>To install the replacement dialog, install it somewhere on your system and DO NewEditPropertyDialog.APP to register it as the dialog to use.<p>The Edit Property/Method dialog replacement assumes the <a href="indexpage.htm" >New Property/Method dialog replacement</a> is installed in the same folder because it run this dialog when you click the "New" button.<p>The Edit Property/Method Dialog Replacement was created by Marcia Akins.
