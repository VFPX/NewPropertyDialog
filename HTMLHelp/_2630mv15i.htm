<br>One thing many VFP developers have always wanted to do was replace the New Property and New Method dialogs. Since thanks to Member Data, we now have the ability to display custom properties and methods in any case we desire, we'd rather have VFP use the case we enter into the New Property or New Method dialog than have to bring up the MemberData Editor and change the case for a new member. Also, it annoying that we have to click the Add button to add a new property or method and then click the Close button to close the dialog. Since we often just add one property or method at a time, it would be nice to have a button that both adds the member and closes the dialog.<p>Such a replacement actually comes with VFP 9, although it's somewhat buried. To get at it, select the Solution Samples pane of the Task Pane Manager, expand the New in Visual FoxPro 9.0 heading, and choose the FoxCode Menu Scripts sample. In the dialog that appears, click the Enable Script and Install New Properties Dialog Sample buttons to enable the replacement dialog.<p><img src="images\figure1.gif"><p>The New Property/Method Dialog Replacement was created by Doug Hennig.
