<br>This help file documents the New Property/Method Replacement Dialog VFPX project.<p>One thing many VFP developers have always wanted to do was replace the New Property and New Method dialogs. Since thanks to Member Data, we now have the ability to display custom properties and methods in any case we desire, we'd rather have VFP use the case we enter into the New Property or New Method dialog than have to bring up the MemberData Editor and change the case for a new member. Also, it's annoying that we have to click the Add button to add a new property or method and then click the Close button to close the dialog. Since we often just add one property or method at a time, it would be nice to have a button that both adds the member and closes the dialog.<p>To install the New Property/Method Replacement Dialog, simply DO <i>path</i>\NewPropertyDialog.APP, where <i>path</i> is the directory where you installed it. That will register the dialog with VFP so it will be used rather than the native dialog. See the <a href="_1t5107ulq.htm" >How it Works</a> topic for details on how that is done.<p>The New Property/Method Replacement Dialog was created by Doug Hennig.
